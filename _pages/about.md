Hello everyone, my name is Zhuoyao Yang üêß. I am a female undergraduate student majoring in philosophy at the University of Sydney. My academic journey is a deep dive into the exploration of human thought and the nature of existence. In this challenging and enlightening field, I am dedicated to deepening my understanding of the history, theories, and practices of philosophy daily.

My passion for philosophy began in high school, driven by a curiosity about human behavior and ways of thinking. Over time, this curiosity transformed into a desire to understand the world and our place in it more profoundly. Choosing to study philosophy at the University of Sydney was a decision to gain more specialized and systematic training in this field.

My experience at the University of Sydney has greatly enriched my knowledge and broadened my perspectives. I have engaged in a variety of courses covering topics from classical to contemporary philosophy. Additionally, I actively participate in extracurricular activities like philosophy clubs and seminars, allowing me to engage deeply with like-minded peers and professors.

In the future, I hope to translate my academic achievements into practical applications. I aim not only to contribute to the academic world but also to promote the value and importance of philosophy in broader society through education and public service. I believe that understanding philosophy enables us to better comprehend ourselves and our relationship with the world.
